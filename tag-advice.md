That’s a smart thing to zero in on — **"tags"** are one of the most powerful (but also most ambiguous) concepts in a system like this.

---

### 💡 Core Question: **Should tags be free-form or pre-defined?**

Each option has pros and cons:

---

## 🆓 Option A: **Free-form tags**

> e.g., `tag="de-duped_v2"` or `tag="for-julia"` or `tag="cleaned"`

#### ✅ Pros

* Extremely flexible (more like Git)
* Users can use whatever terminology matches their workflow or org
* Encourages creativity and experimentation

#### ❌ Cons

* Inconsistent tagging (`cleaned` vs `clean`, `final` vs `FINAL`)
* Hard to filter or automate based on tags
* No guarantees or structure (harder to support downstream tools)

---

## ✅ Option B: **Predefined tag set**

> e.g., from `["raw", "intermediate", "cleaned", "final", "ad-hoc"]`

#### ✅ Pros

* Consistent taxonomy across teams
* Easier to visualize progression in a pipeline (e.g., raw → cleaned → final)
* Safer for automation, dashboards, and pipeline logic
* Fewer user errors

#### ❌ Cons

* Might feel limiting for power users
* Doesn’t handle every workflow nuance
* Might require adding “Other” or “Notes” field to provide context

## 🧩 Option C: **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**

Let users pick from a suggested list (enforced by default), **but allow opt-out** for advanced users.

You could implement this as:

```python
DEFAULT_TAGS = {"raw", "intermediate", "cleaned", "final", "ad-hoc"}

def save(..., tag="raw", enforce_tags=True):
    if enforce_tags and tag not in DEFAULT_TAGS:
        raise ValueError(f"Tag '{tag}' not in allowed list: {DEFAULT_TAGS}")
```

In CLI:

```bash
datashelf save --tag raw           ✅
datashelf save --tag "for-marketing"  ❌ (unless enforce_tags=False or flag given)
```

Maybe even support a `datashelf.config.yaml` where users can toggle strict tag enforcement or define their own valid tags.

---

### 🔮 Strategic Benefits of the Hybrid Approach

* You support **structured reproducibility** (important for long-term usability)
* You allow flexibility and **gradual onboarding** for teams
* You open the door to:

  * Tag-based filtering (`list_versions(tag="raw")`)
  * Tag heatmaps or timelines (`show dataset evolution by tag`)
  * Pipeline consistency (`final` versions only go to production)

### 📌 Suggested Default Tags

These are good general-purpose, neutral tags that align with real-world data workflows:

| Tag            | Meaning                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `raw`          | Directly ingested / untouched |
| `intermediate` | Partially processed or joined |
| `cleaned`      | Cleaned and ready for use     |
| `final`        | Production-ready              |
| `ad-hoc`       | One-off or exploratory work   |

You could also allow projects to define their own taxonomy if desired later.

Would you like help thinking through where this validation or configuration logic should live in the codebase (e.g., in `core.py`, `shelf.py`, or config files)?
